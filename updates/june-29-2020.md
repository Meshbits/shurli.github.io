Dart language only interoperable with C language, so any language exports it's functions and datatypes for C and those are called in Dart.  
I just tried Golang code and called the functions in C language code, with Dynamic library linking and Dynamically loading the .so library. Read the C code from sample code where I learned it from, and can understand the C language code part fine.  
Also got the Dart sample code to use FFI, but it did not work as expected:

Gonna try sorting this out first before I move ahead....
