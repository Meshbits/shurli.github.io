things are progressing slowly but consistently in Shurli development.  
I did start Flutter front-end code and made stub front end for testing. it's just very basic so far.  
Thought it would be better if I instead use existing data than stub values and doing the gRPC API to finish first, where I'm at right now.  
In progress Flutter UI of Shurli looks like this:  
  
![flutter_shurli_ui_test](https://github.com/meshbits/shurli.github.io/blob/master/images/20200625/flutter_shurli_ui_test.png?raw=true)  
  
  
When @khatana will have the designs for frontend ready, I'll do the GUI code according to those designs  
I think it's best until then I finish up on the gRPC work  
hopefully by then the Shurli Logo will be finalised and we will be then working on the GUI design work  
thought I give couple of you guys some update here. been long time ðŸ™‚
