okay, fixed it to understand it better  
I just removed all other unnecessary example function codes to minimise the scope to test and verify the process of executing a function from a library file using Dart  
just included Add function from .so file which was compiled from go üôÇ   
and called it from .dart file, and it seem to work as expected  
my requirement is just that small as I see  
I only need to execute the main() function of my gRPC server go code, and I guess just calling a single function to execute should be enough to start gRPC as the Dart based flutter app starts  
will do that test next, with a simple hello greeter gRPC example code, again keeping it's scope less for this testing üòÅ  

right now, I'm only trying to solve the challenges I have in mind to make sure I don't get stuck too long on those  
so made gRPC with 2 APIs to make sure I understand and it works as expected  
then tested FFI code of go, called the functions from compiled library in C language file  
and then in Dart  
Also, followed up Flutter's documentation to test the Add function in flutter for both iOS and Android  
so at least these steps I have tested and validated that I can at least do something and what kind of challenges there are further  
so, adding more further APIs to gRPC seems easy now, since I have experienced and tested that  
the challenge after testing FFI I identified is to make the gRPC server start by calling the main function which will start the gRPC server within App!  
it is a challenge, since if just starting the `go run server.go` it stops the stdout on the command prompt and waits for the keyboard input signal like CTRL+C to cancel or kill the process  
so this behaviour I need to manage with the Dart code  
but I have already tried this earlier üôÇ  
with Shurli  
when I made it a daemon and just gave it a start/stop command over command line  
so I can just make the start/stop argument for the library file too, and let the gRPC server run in the background process and also kill it  
so this whole mindmap of problems and solutions been a long trail of efforts in last few months  
I still expect challenges, since Dart's FFI is in beta stage! and I found that advanced Go to Dart interaction a bit tricky, which I'll need to wrap my head around to properly fix any issues if arise in future
