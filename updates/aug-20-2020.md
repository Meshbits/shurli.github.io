@SHossain thought I continue here since the next chat is more relevant to Shurli.

That's what I'm trying to do now

the idea is to start SHURLI0

then generate a transparent and private address

gather the public key

and the private keys

then show those in the SHURLI web UI in settings page

and beside the supported wallet icons on Dashboard, show a button saying "Launch Wallet" or something like that

and start the QT wallet using the pubkey obtained from SHURLI0

once the wallet starts in GUI, ask the user to copy the private key and import in the QT wallet GUI

I actually need to try that importprivkey part again and see if I try to import the privkey from cli does it still show the rescuing part UI part in QT GUI

if it does, then can also execute the import private key command from the GUI as well, just completing the wallet setup as well

I think that will help the newbie users a lot

and right now testing this with existing PoC web GUI

and adding this API call to my subatomic go package/library

so it will be seamlessly usable in my Flutter code as well in gRPC API

I can just bundle the OceanQT wallet along with other komodod and komodo-cli binaries with Shurli

okay, confirmed. importing private key from cli or API command shows the rescanning info box on QT GUI

can now handle of importing/dumping privkey etc in backend code

on the other updates, which I shared with users on keybase, I did small progress on Flutter and gRPC side of code too. I accept it's very slow progress, but something nonetheless.

Able to call gRPC calls on Flutter on both Desktop and mobile Android App for subatomic gRPC setup

so with the next application server/client based architecture setup mobile subatomic swaps could be possible too.

It's just the Alice side client GUI

the Bob side server GUI will be made once Alice side is done

I used the GUI style idea from @Pwnz he shared sometime ago.

I did not had any other GUI style idea, so just tried his style :stuck_out_tongue:
